    <h2>Description</h2>
    Costa Rican beans and rice dish as published by <a href="https://stripedspatula.com/gallo-pinto/">striped spatula</a>, with some edits based on how I make it at home.
    <p>From the site:</p>
    <p><i>"Gallo Pinto means, quite literally, 'Spotted Rooster' in Spanish, characterizing the speckled appearance of the dark beans against the white rice.</i></p>
    <p><i>It’s typically served as a part of a hearty breakfast, alongside fried or scrambled eggs, with accompaniments such as sour cream ('natilla' in Costa Rica, which is thinner than the American variety), a crispy slice of fried white cheese ('queso frito'), plantains, sliced avocado, a corn tortilla, and a strong cup of coffee."</i></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons light-tasting oil (vegetable, mild olive, or canola)</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cans cooked black beans</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Salsa Lizano</li>
        <li>~2 cups cooked rice (preferably day-old and refrigerated)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <!-- TODO -->
        <li>Wash 1 cup of white rice, add water up to 2 cup mark, and prepare rice in rice cooker (night before if possible).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Sauté chopped bell pepper and onions until peppers are soft and onions are translucent, about 6-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add black beans and Salsa Lizano, stirring to combine. Simmer for 5 minutes, until slightly thickened and little bit of the liquid is evaporated.</li>
        <li>Gently stir in cooked rice and cook until heated through and most of the liquid is absorbed, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in chopped cilantro. Season to taste with salt and additional Salsa Lizano, if desired, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
