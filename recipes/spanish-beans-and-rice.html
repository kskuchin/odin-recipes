    <p>From the site:</p>
    <p><i>"Spanish Rice and Beans uses pantry staples to create a nutritious, 
        flavorful one pot meal. Vegetarian, gluten free, and so simple to make, 
        this rice and beans recipe will become a staple.</i></p>
    <p><i>Rice and beans is as complete of a meal on itâ€™s own as you can get. 
        This is because the rice and beans provide complementary amino acids... 
        most grains are deficient in lysine, while beans are of the few plant 
        foods rich in lysine. On the flip side, many beans provide only small 
        amounts of the amino acid methionine, which is rich in most grains."</i></p>
