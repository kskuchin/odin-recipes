    <h2>Description</h2>
    Rajma beans and rice dish as published by 
    <a href="https://www.teaforturmeric.com/rajma-recipe/">Tea for Turmeric</a>, 
    with some edits based on how I make it at home.
    <p>From the site:</p>
    <p><i>"Here’s a one-pot, flavorful North Indian-style Rajma Masala recipe. 
        This recipe transforms the humble red kidney bean into a creamy yet 
        light, textured curry. Top with red onions (more texture!) and serve 
        with basmati rice for a cozy, wholesome meal. Includes instructions for 
        using both dried and canned red kidney beans."</i></p>

        <li>2 medium (~200 g) Roma or Vine tomatoes, puréed/blended in a food 
            processor</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (33 g) tomato paste</li>
        <!-- Can I just use a can or two of tomato puree here? -->
        <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp Kashmiri chili powder or paprika</li>
        <li>1/3 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp red chili powder or cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 3/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2-3 small Thai chili or serrano peppers, left whole or halved 
            lengthwise (deseed to reduce heat)</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp heavy whipping cream, half and half, or coconut milk </li>
        <li>1 tbsp (14 g) salted butter (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves, kasuri methi, crushed between the 
            palms of your hands</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>2 tbsp finely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion, sliced or chopped</li>
        <li>Lemon or lime wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash 1 cup of basmati rice, add water up to 2 cup mark, and prepare 
            rice in rice cooker (night before if possible).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the 
            onions and whole spices (cumin seeds, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, 
            peppercorns, and black cardamom). Sauté for 7-8 minutes, until the 
            onions turn golden brown. Deglaze with 2-3 tbsp of water.</li>
        <li>Once the water dries up, add the garlic and ginger and sauté for 
            another 2 minutes, until aromatic and the onions deepen even more in
            color. If the garlic/ginger start to stick, deglaze again with 2-3 
            tbsp water.</li>
        <li>Add the blended tomatoes and tomato paste and sauté for about 5 
            minutes, until the tomatoes reduce and the oil starts to leave the 
            sides.</li>
        <li>Pour in 1/4 cup water to deglaze the pan. Add ground spices and salt 
            and sauté for 1-2 minutes to bloom the spices. The oil will once 
            again release from the onion-tomato mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked kidney beans and stir to coat in the masala. Using a 
            wooden spoon, gently mash the kidney beans for better texture. Pour 
            in the measured water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a light boil (cover to make it boil faster), then reduce 
            heat to medium. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 
            minutes. The mixture will have thickened up, but it should still be 
            runny.</li>
        <li>Uncover and cook for another 1-2 minutes, continuing to crush the 
            kidney beans with a wooden spoon. The mixture should still be soupy,
            but thick enough to start to stick to the bottom if left alone. If 
            the mixture thickens too much, add 1/4-1/2 cup water and allow to 
            come to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the green chili peppers, heavy cream, butter, and fenugreek 
            leaves. Stir gently to combine.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low. Cover and gently simmer for 3 minutes. The 
            oil will start to rise and line the sides of the curry.</li>
        <li>Garnish with garam masala and cilantro. Turn off the heat. Pair with
            basmati rice. Serve with sliced red onions and lemon wedges on the 
            side.</li>
    </ol>
