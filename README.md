# odin-recipes

Practice setting up a website using basic HTML, by way of the Odin Project 
curriculum. This site contains a few recipes that I commonly make at home, or 
want to make - these are adapted from recipes already published online by others,
and the originals are linked on each recipe page. So far, all recipes here are
variations of beans and rice, which I love.
